# FingerIn-doorOpener
System for opening doors using fingerprint scanner and RFID reader

The prototypes were fabricate in Germany and delivered to me on 03/07/2020. After assembling and test them all the system works fine.

There is just one mistake I made.
Because I tried at the first place with some RJ45 sockets which I bought from Amazon and they were not the right once I didn't nottice that the RJ45 socket pins are runing on the other way araund. So when the prototypes arrived I understood that they are fitting upside down. Anyway that hadn't made any issues and everything working fine.
